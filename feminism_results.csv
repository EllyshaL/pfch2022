The book is also important because of its rarity, with only a few known repositories registering it in their collections. Botting will discuss how the digitization of the book for its bicentennial by the Library of Congress is a vital step in encouraging further scholarship on this landmark work of feminist philosophy and American political thought, including the question of the book's reception and influence in the early to mid-19th century, especially among feminists and abolitionists.
